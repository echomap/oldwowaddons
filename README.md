# OldWowAddons
My old wow addons for storage (were on curseforge)

For Classic Wow I wrote these:
* **Artemis** -> A stable viewer and hunter trap/aspect/tracker bar addon for classic wow.

A long time ago I wrote these:

* **RealmImIn** -> an addon that would show what realm you were logged into, per I had too many characters on too many servers
* **Stable**    -> a hunter stable/pet tracking addon with a GUI to show the critter.
